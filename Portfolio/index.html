                <p>I'm Chloe and these are the inventions I like to display! There are tons of others that don't make it here..</p>
                <p>I call my projects Inventions-</p>

                <ul> In these inventions, I try to include:
                    <li>Starting point: What was I trying to achieve or solve? Sometimes it was just for the aesthetics.</li>
                    <li>The perfect vision I had in mind: A silly habit of imagining something perfect, and have it crash with the imperfection of the material.</li>
                    <li>Materials & Tools Used: Specific tools, software, platforms etc. I always want these to be free or FOSS</li>
                    <li>Process: An overview of how it was done, best with step-by-step</li>
                    <li>Results: Did it work? What were the final results?</li>
                    <li>To Improve: What would I do differently next time?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For older inventions-- which I wouldn't really remember the methods-- I write an article with mostly my feelings about an invention.</p>
