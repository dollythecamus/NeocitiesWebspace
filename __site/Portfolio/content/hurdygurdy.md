# Hurdy Gurdy
> The best invention I've ever built. at the same time the dumbest

It's not a hard bar to push myself over this "best invention" - it's honestly pretty mediocre. -- alright i'm just putting myself down. it's a good piece, and at the time, I loved it. But now it shows it's age, it's silly bravery of something I had no business doing but did anyway. It cost some hundreds of real. Remembering it at about eight- eight hundred real for a ffteen year old kid in Brazil with not many opportunities to engage in the type of building project I always thought I would like to do, but never encouraged, really.

Oh I should tell you- the hurdy gurdy is the musical instrument pictured. it's a wheel and crank viola with a keyboard that sits in one's lap. it's a completely silly instrument, and most people who come to know it, fall in love with it.
This one specifically is built from a kit called the Nerdy Gurdy. It took me about 3 weeks to complete, with some challenge. I'm uncertain about the time it was built - around mid 2021. i was 15 years old

I'm remembering better now. there is probably a piece of printed writing inside of it-- you know how some acoustic instruments have a print saying "this was made by me, from this company" --with some names of people i would rather forget but will always stay in my mind. one day i might break it appart, finally, and see that piece of writing again.

I haaaated how it was used for. this whole project was supposed to be a simple school presentation bullshit. I was the one who turned it into making this hurdy gurdy, and it seemed to me in retrospect like nobody really liked it. i also don't like it so maybe i shouldn't be so salty about it. 
the presentation was some bullshit i don't remember or care, but it had a musical piece with performance from the students. so i played my hurdy gurdy but the ONLY THING that i was allowed to do with this marvelous instrument was-- shit-- spin the wheel slowly with one of the heavy drone strings. so it just made a boring soft hummmm that could be made by anything, and i was the idiot spinning the crank slowly every second. it was DREAFUL. 
everybody applauded the way you are suppose to applaud children being ridiculous beginners, and that's fine. i'm still salty.

and it's breaking appart now. it was breaking appart just a week after the presentation really. and with every time i tension the strings the body deforms and cracks just a little more.

### The Lessons this whole thing taught me today, writing this:
- be bolder with presenting something awesome
- be bolder with commiting to big projects
- stuff meant to be good and lasting is not made out of rubish materials
	- don't build a musical instrument out of MDF wood, more specifically. it will be bad

### more thoughts about it:

the problem with the mdf wood is that it sucks. it was also the only option provided for me from the professional maker shop in this damn capital city, even though I ABSOLUTELY know that (at least) plywood will come in the same thickness and be somewhat better.

not only that (which plywood would probably not solve) is the mdf- being made out of wood scrap and glue- will never be smooth- will transpire the glue to the instrument- the keys got all stuck and it got impossible to play a single note.

the 3d printed parts are good. no complaints. i really love my 3d printer, and i should show it some more love.

I should have a video from me at the time playing "13" by Tally Hall on it. i'm gonna look for it.
-- nevermind. looking for this video made me go on unhealthy thought cycles of wondering what the people i interacted with in the past would think of me today. OFF with this nonsense.

```"imaginary friends"
## hurdy gurdy

cranky frankenstein monster
bad by design
mad about being born
still cute to look at. even after i bit off chunks of it
give it a paint over and a face or something
```
this was for some kind of thought exercise to give names and personalities to everything in my bedroom. maybe i should try that again.

My life's mission is to acquire a good one
_and_ to make one

some small note on my feelings about the instrument

```"i wanted to play a hurdy gurdy"
#lyrics #music 

# i wanted to play a hurdy gurdy

oooh, i wanted to play a hurdy gurdy
but i don't have a hurdy gurdy
and i wanted to play a hurdy gurdy
so i tried to build a hurdy gurdy

but i didn't cut the right type of wood
it didn't make it sound any good
the keys all stick, the body broke down
now my hurdy gurdy don't make a sound

oooh, i wanted to play a hurdy gurdy
but i don't have a hurdy gurdy
and i wanted to play a hurdy gurdy
so i tried to build a hurdy gurdy

LISTEN TO THIS!!!

(hurdy gurdy fail)

i had to get this thing from all the dust on it
it sounds like it came out of hell

oooh my hurdy gurdy is the same as junk
no better than a pretty decoration
i made a hurdy-gurdy-shaped-object
maybe i can't be a luthier
```
lyrics written for a song about a hurdy gurdy. some sort of folk punk abomination. pretty funny
