# Website Changelog! 

a changelog is a thing tech-inclined people do when they want to write a diary of stuff they changed in their little projects, it's kind of cute.

this website is being updated a lot since the start in May 2025. I should recommend that you occasionaly delete this website's data from your browser, so that it loads the new scripts.

website version is completely arbitrary btw. I just add some numbers to it when it feels right.

### Changelog Command:
> for me to remember :p

> Pretty
```git log --pretty=format:"---%n### %s%nTime: %ad%n" --date=short > __site/changelog-pretty.md```
> Less pretty
