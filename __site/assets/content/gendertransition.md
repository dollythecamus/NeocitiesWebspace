I want to talk about my transition and how it is going, would you listen?

it is not going well. My family doesn’t support me and I don’t have an income to become independent from them. I feel isolated and irritated that they wouldn’t help me when they are supposed to love and support me. I have saved up some money though, I can probably pay for a few months of the medicine I want to do DIY HRT. I would have to hide it from them as best I can until my body changes start to become too obvious to hide. I wish I didn’t have to do that because I know the risks of doing medical procedures without medical guidance.

# it's easy to be a transgender person

just hide your feelings. do not let anyone see them. especially those you trust. those are the most likely to crush those feelings you hold so so dear. hurting more from the disappointment of learning you can never trust them again.

_seriously now_

like that one meme with the pink blob that gets punched into their box because the try to be vulnerable. only to look themselves on a stronger box.

that is the plan- for the time being, I will do nothing. I will change nothing about myself and suffer quietly. I will acquire my better chance at life in the united states and when I arrive- I will disappear. have the courage to be hated by these ridiculous people. never trust them again. make the life I want for myself by finally acquiring real freedom.

turns out, this did not work. I'm getting my estrogen soon.

# history of the entire gender i guess

whats that
for many centuries it was like classifying people by if their reproductive organ was innie or outtie. also if there was anything in between, they'd be multilated. and we made a big deal about it (gendurr)

the innies were sorta segregated into being domestic slaves and violenced upon. while the outties were given positions of power and bragged about peeing while standing even though innies can technically do it with an appropriate hygiene device, yet all of the public infrastructure was engineered with the effect of making innies uncomfortable having to sit on the apparatus which the outties promptly urinated on top of.

we kinda always knew it was fucked up, but most wouldn't do much about it
and there are some relatively harmless aspects of this people sorting too, like clothing styles and general manneurisms

then sometime a billion years ago, we made the quite obvious insight that these concepts are entirely constructed by the society we live in. innie people begun wearing pants, since then, patriarchy basically imploded
but while it didn't, people made a really big deal about it

"outties shouldn't wear skirts! we don't want testicles hangin like a grandfather clock" they would say, wrongly
they were quite naive thinking that this wasn't a big appeal of outties wearing skirts
"innies can't be president! their uterus makes for a bad brain and bad politics! like safe and legal abortions!" oh how impressively ignorant were those of the past

now it's over
we all display our testicles and tits like it's an art exhibit
everyone is gay and trans until stated otherwise

# microdose suicída

> cool band name btw

não é segredo que eu não gosto de mim mesma.
mas a natureza desse desgosto não vem de insuficiência diante das demandas da sociedade, eu nem gosto da sociedade para considerar suas demandas de qualquer valor.
meu desgosto de mim, mais certamente, vem da inabilidade do meu verdadeiro ser de conseguir ser livre por causa de alguns simples desacordos emocionais que se compõem numa única grande bagunça mental. 

eu quero me vestir de um outro jeito, pra isso preciso da coragem que não tenho
eu adoraria ter amigos e me divertir, pra isso preciso da coragem que não tenho
eu adoraria viver viajando e livre de preocupações usuais da vida em sociedade geral, pra isso preciso da coragem que não tenho
preciso da coragem para ser vista como uma decepção ou desgostada, as vezes. é o que eu preciso para conseguir o que eu realmente quero para tantos desejos.

desse intervalo entre a coragem que eu não tenho e a que eu preciso vem o desgosto de mim, pelo menos por agora.
ninguém me ensinou coragem, só me ensinaram complacência diante de demandas mundanas. eu preciso construir essa coragem sozinha, como tantas outras coisas que ninguém me ajudou a construir.

# if you're trans you have to keep living

please. 

if you are trans and in the internet you've maybe seen posts like the title, on tumblr for instance.

they say: if you are trans, please keep living. even though it's hard, it's so hard. please keep living, you have to.

trans activism in lots of places is becoming suicide prevention first, because other types of help that trans people want, for instance accessible medical care for transition is becoming illegal and equated with abuse, especially for minors.

transphobes and terfs don't want to keep people in the wrong bathrooms because they are so logically consistent in regards to biology. they're not, they don't know shit about biology

what they want is for you to be sad about every waking moment of your life, no matter how banal, and then kill yourself.

and i don't want to die, most of the time, if an artist kills themselves every piece of their art becomes a suicide note. that would be tragic and oh so stupid
