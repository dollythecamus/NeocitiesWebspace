## tutorial
> i feel like you need a tutorial because i complicated the whole website to be quirky --
> you can drag the button around!

that button in the center that goes ** is the navigation menu, and some other utility. every page has a different configuration of those buttons.

important ones in this homepage are:

📃 -> pages - actual practical navigation to all parts of the website

🎛️ -> changelog - see the changes of the website

✨ -> colors - change the colors!

💟 -> toggle decorations

> remember: everything is under construction.

please go explore :)
