# THE BEST SUPER POWER

## Shapeshifting

but how would it work

-- What is it?

- consciouslly changing the shape, composition, function of a biological body
- does NOT include changing matter or laws of physics/chemistry
+
-- ok how tho

- (most magical part) _consciouslly_ editing genetic material for a desired result, and having the cells perform this new function in the body
	- like, how would brain activity really change how the cells behave/ are composed of?
	- so maybe it shouldn't be just "brain activity" that does the consciousness, could be a mind matter like decartes but whatever. magical
	- this also requires an intelligent understanding and intention of how genetics changes the functions of lifeforms
- revert specified cells into stem cells that then specify into functional cells
- quickly

-- WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS

- changing sex on a whim. this should be the coolest part yea BUT NOT ALL OF IT
- cloning is easier than ever
- anything relating to GMO
- biological immortality, basically
- cut your finger off and transform it into some new lifeform
- gotta eat tons to get big boy energy
- GMO superfast growth trees with highly energetic fruit
	- spread these fruits everywhere in the world and solve hunger
- living alien-like space ships
	- tardigrades! tardigrade space ships!!!!
- repopulating ancient extinct species
- fractalian penopticon
- all sorts of magic that could be done with biology
- tentacle hentai
- sexy wolves who can consent
- living colossal god-like eldritch horrors beyond comprehenssion
