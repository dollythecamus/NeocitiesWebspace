A game I thought about to play in anything you can write on.

1. Make up a word out of random syllables, just make some sounds and see what you get. Or get a random generator, or do it with new words you didn't know anything about previously
2. Attach feelings to that word, starting with the five senses you can gather from the feeling/vibe about the word: color, taste, smell, texture, sound.
3. For extra effects: Moment in time, history of it, philosophy about it, etmology, images, animals who have that feeling, and any other meaning you might want to attach.
4. More suggestions: Season, character from media, character from history, person in your life, brand, car model, personality, religious signifier, art style, work of architecture, alcoholic beverage, softness, squichness, a song, a painting, use it in a sentence. Whatever you want really.

I found that when I play this game for a few minutes, I am better at visualizing things in my mind.
I was a little worried of losing the ability to visualize in my mind, so this helps.
