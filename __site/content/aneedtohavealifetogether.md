contemporary white liberal existential dread

that familiar feeling

we really want to have a life together

this is not an achievable goal, not now, not ever

the concept of "a life together" or "a good life"

that we want

is not defined by you

it's a social construction 

---

we want simple stuff

comforting stuff

like love

it's quite simple, really. trust, intimacy, companionship, belonging, purpose

simple stuff. it feels simple when it happens



real stuff, the bad stuff

is never simple

so many layers, choices and behaviours mutually enforced

usually, a bad thing existed for a long time, and you ignore it while it's small

it grows bad

and when you finally take a look at the mess 

it's horrifying

what i do in those situations, which are happening a lot in my own life recently

is that i run away

aaaaaaaah how convenient

i chose to ignore it, again

it will grow worse and more disgusting

and corroding my soul

and there's no way to fight that

i will keep hiding

i will keep sneaking away so that it won't find me

and that will be my curse in lifetime

am i a monster

do i need to be corrected, there seems to be something so deeply wrong with me

i dont want to be a villain, i really dont. but what other role do people allow me to play?

is it my doing? did i want this? 

i dont like following the standards that others set for me, they come unexplained and are often deeply stupid

are some standards they set good? how can i tell the difference? they come unexplained either way
