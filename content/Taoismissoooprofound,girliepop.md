# Taoism is sooo profound, girliepop

Idea: "Buddhism is kinda out there, man" by exurb1a, but Taoism and inverted on it's head (why girliepop).

(inspired by **"Buddhism is kinda out there, man" by exurb1a**, I decided to make my own version about Taoism)

morning comes, and you wake, with the memories of yourself as you were the previous night, worried sick about the next day.

when you heart speaks to you: "If I didn't have a self, what problems would I have?" and with that phrase in mind, your stomach says: "I'm hungry", and you go eat.

Is that the same person, the same self that was worrying last night?

worrying about your relationship, about your job, about your lifepath, about your family, about your mind, about your sickness, about your eventual death, about unkindness, about a world that is apathetic and alienating.
