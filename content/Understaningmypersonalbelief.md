# Understanding my personal belief â€”

I think about religions as their set of beliefs, rituals, places, communities etc
I could say within a belief system of, say, a monotheistic religion, there is a god, and that god means a lot of things but mainly it is what puts nature into action. what makes things happen is god. and i could also say that within that religion this god is treated as something real, universal and appart from subjective understading, it exists outside our minds in the world we live in.
about polytheistic religions, many gods could take different aspects or powers within different actions of nature. but in the same way, they are treated as if they were real and appart from a subjective understanding, they exist.

i could say that the real part is wrong, as an atheist/agnostic understanding that there is no god that puts action into nature, or at least, this god if it exists, cannot ever be known to actually exist and it makes little sense to take a leap of faith into a belief that will never be proven

but at the same time.
I can use the concept of deities inside of my own subjective experience of having a mind- and have all the spiritual/existential benefits that is believed to come from a belief system. but crutially- not impose on anyone this belief, not claim that it acts in the material world, not claim to be able to change any material circumstance by this belief.

now why would this matter at all? kinda sounds pointless...

and, yea, if a material world is all that exists
but we can talk in a psychological sense, not a spiritual one: that the mind is real. we all have the experience of the mind as something real and subjective and hard to describe, but it's there.

About wicca, it's a religion that assumes a polytheistic view and that it's gods are real etc
and uses of witchcraft rituals and practices as lifestyle and wellness improvement, all relating to a mystic view of nature drawn from various cultures in european folklore. like prayer does to catholics, like breath focus does to buddhists.

so finally as a hipothetical example to illustrate this sort of thinking:

say a wicca practicioner lives with too much social anxiety, they decide that is not what they want, and with a bit of magick, they might be able to change their circumstances. they cast a spell, write sigils, recite some encantations and keep a protection jewl that will all aliviate their anxiety, and it works! they don't feel so anxious as they previously were, because they believe those practices will, and have, aliviated their anxiety by their own belief. huge w.

What I would say that actually happened, and that we don't need to assume any supernatural belief to get the same results: social anxiety is really bad and what this wiccan did was, through enforcing the idea in their mind that the anxiety would go away with these practices, actually made their mind change, sort of subconsciously, to direct them into a more realistic thinking that excludes anxiety from their worries. it was all in the mind.

trying to illustrate this again, that i don't know if i did a particularly good job at explaining

I could take a calmomila tea, and relieve my anxiety
especially if I believe that calmomila tea relieves anxiety, even if it could not be scientifically accurate

sort of placebo religion- that we may even know that it's not real, but we can kinda pretend that it is and still collect all the benefits that would bring to believe it.
