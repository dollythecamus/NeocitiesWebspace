this is my bedroom, it's the bedroom I've always slept in my whole life.
how it relates to my story is that it's empty.
there are things inside. but in the way that things inside your stomach aren't really "inside" you. remember that humans are like a topological straw.

the boring white plaster walls, some parts written with markers that were erased. the markings behind the door that would've tracked my height over the years are painted over. white celling and cold lights that really don't make this place mine.

it's distant to my own soul. I'm not sure if it was at some point. I have little memory of my childhood, back then. it's my grandmother's raging control over the house and, in my opinion, her terrible taste in decor that could make my living space into... this.

I have "misery 09/02/2022" written at the back of the door. that was during a maniac episode where I thought I could try to make the world a better place and solve hunger, or something.
notably, this maniac episode happened when i had a relationship break up but was too scared to admit i was feeling anything at all

I made some terrariums, there's this big tank that was my turtle's home that I will also turn into a terarrium.
there are many musical instruments, all of which I play terribly because I never practice or produce anything musical. I don't like to bother other people with noise...

oh, hey. I can make my bedroom better.
I'll try to do that...

the first step to making art is you have to fail
there are no more steps
but you made it
