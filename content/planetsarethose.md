# Planets. why are they those ones

2006 pluto thing

- It must orbit a star
- It must be massive enough to have be in hydrostatic equilibrium. use gravity to force it into a spherical or round shape.
- It must be massive enough that its gravity has cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.

this definition by the AUI sucks
a simpler and better definition is just:
massive enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (look spherical, at least rounded), but not so massive it's a star; it's a planet
and have types of planets within this definition

earth is an alive planet
moon is a dusty planet, so is mars, so is mercury (idk i didn't check)
a lot of the small planets are dusty planets
venus is a hellish planet, so is probably Titan, but Titan is cold
Jupiter and saturn are gas giant planets yea
Europa can be a under-ocean planet idk
icy world planets
etc

new planet names and designs i made up just because!!!

this part is hard, to make the art for every planet but I can try!!

Earth Moon Mars Venus
Titan Europa Callisto
Pluto Makemake
Saturn Uranus

turns out i made nothing. i thought of this cool idea and made nothing again. huh
