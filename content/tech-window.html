    <h2>Tech info about the webiste!</h2> 
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>made in a screen of 1920x1080 pixels</p>
    <p>sorry if it doesn't work for other windows!</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>made with love and everything nice</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!</p>
    <p>while under construction, maybe delete your history when you visit again, to reload the images</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>the webdev side of me is only good enough to know what to edit in a file, and i can code decent enough. i got chatbots to write a lot of the code for this (especially the solar system(there's a solar system!)) but it comes out buggy so i gotta fix most of it...</p>
    <p>the content in the actual pages are real words, writen by a real girl, don't worry :p</p>
    <p>but on the other hand, robot girls are valid</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>this escaped me, it's not technical information anymore</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>beyond robot girl yuri in my mind right now, a lot of this webpage was only possible due to tutorials and help from the internet, so thanks to all the people who made those!</p>
