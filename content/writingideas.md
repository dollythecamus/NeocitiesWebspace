#### writing  ideas i had some months ago

## selfcest genderfluid cloning
> Self-Love Experiments
- a lonely boy invents cloning so that they clone himself as a girl he can love
- self-aware of how patriarchy interacts with this
- both of them are trans

## butch lesbian space adventurer
- building a space suit
- making the space suit into punk fashion
- being space pirates with her robot gf

## the superpower that solves all problems
it's [[shapeshifting]]
it's the type of fantasy i think about when i need to sleep at night
don't write a narrative about it. write an encyclopedia or an atlas of the world with shapeshifting. 
that would be more coherent and i don't have ideas for characters or anything

## Noachia
> new myth, martian, kinda new-agey mystic
