    i guess i'm scared that i'm imaginary <br>
    that i invent myself everyday so other people don't have to <br>
    that what i really am is secondary <br> to what i want everyone else to see <br>
    and im scared im crazy <br>
    but god help me <br>
    im twice as scared im sane <br>
    then what excuse do i have for treating people like problems <br>that need to be solved or explained <br>
